                <h2>What do I want to do after College?</h2>
                <p>After I finish college, I hope to enter an
apprenticeship or university. I would be open to an apprenticeship
because I will gain an abundance of practical experience and be put
straight into the workplace. I would also be open to university as
I would gather a vast amount of knowledge and qualifications. I will
have to attend university using student loans. 
Although hopefully, I can get a well-paying job
afterwards to pay them off or find an employer that helps pay off
student loans as a benefit for working for them.</p>

                <h2>What do I want to do after education?</h2>
                <p>After I complete my education, I hope to get
a job in the industry quickly. It doesn't have to be exactly what
I want as long as it pays enough for me to be financially secure.
I'm not entirely sure what I want to do yet.</p>

                <h2>Where do I want my career to lead?</h2>
                <p>Eventually, I hope to be in a well-paying job
and live comfortably. At the moment, I am interested in web
development and have been improving my front-end development skills.
Later on, I will learn JavaScript and other web-based languages so
that I can work on the back end of websites. Game development has
also piqued my interest, although having looked into it, a lot of
game developers get overworked and underpaid.</p>
